## Objective
- Have you ever had a tough time going to sleep? Have 
you tried counting sheep? We will make a program that 
will count sheep for you. 

- Begin by creating an integer variable to hold the number 
of sheep. Ask the user how many sheep do they need to count 
before falling asleep (choose between 1-500). Have the user 
‘cin’ the number of sheep into your variable. Create a for 
loop that has an iterator that starts at 1. Add a condition 
that your variable has to be less than or equal the number of sheep 
your user wants. Have your iterator be updated by adding 1 
every time the loop is ran. Inside your for loop, ‘cout’ 
the amount of sheep that have been counted, use your iterator 
to show this. Ex: “You have counted # sheep” Outside of your 
loop ‘cout’ a message you want your user to see before they 
go to sleep.
